description: My story begins. How I acquired "Omen Dictums of Ump".
---
In all religions, we find at least two common denominators.

There is the Maker, the Creator, the god of the Sun, who rises each morning, each cycle, bringing new life and time to his subjects. Each person knows her. Her appearance and reappearance is a cause for joy.

We also find the Unmaker, the Destroyer, the god of Death, sometimes a trickster, sometimes a bludgeon, but always enigmatic and unknown. He is spoken of only in whispers by most people, and the few other details are known of only by the most knowledgeable of priests and seers.

I believe I have inadvertently stumbled on why. It is not simply our human wish to ascribe aspects of our lives to something beyond our insignificant time on this rock. Nor are our myths a self-replicating thought, originated in the mind of a hallucinating ascetic, and spread through the human experience like the ancient equivalent of a internet cat video.

It is because these primal forces are real.

Last night, I was completing my final shift at the university library's Special Collections before leaving for the summer. We have lots of interesting and very old books there. My personal favorite is a copy of *Principia Mathematica* that some unknown person brought with them to the New World in the 18th century. Like many of the books in the cage, it has a time-worn cover, with many notes scribbled in the margins. One almost feels the weight of time and human experience when holding that book with tender, gloved hands.

I passed the *Principia*, but I was not at that moment interested in opening it. There was a flickering light somewhere in the collection, and if it was not replaced, it might eventually spark or burst. I felt a duty to the man-millenia of knowledge contained in the room, and I had to find that light. I pulled up the service request form on the library iPad and walked towards where I believed I would find it.

I found the light, but as I walked underneath it to read the location number, I very nearly tripped over something.

Looking down, I saw a book. It was lying on the floor, closed, with an old-style leather cover and clasp. I crouched to examine it. Luckily for me the spine had taken the brunt of my sneaker, and the book appeared unharmed. I picked it up. Although I expected it to be heavy, as it was perhaps 12x15 inches, and at least 500 pages by modern page thickness, I did not expect to put so much effort into standing and bringing it up to my average height. In small but neat cursive, the cover was inscribed with the words *Omen Dictums of Ump*. No author was indicated on the cover.

Puzzled, I looked around for the spot from which it must have fallen. This particular spot in the collection was held on the left in standard library shelving, spine out, standing vertically, but with attention paid to placing a sliver of space between each title. On the right, each book was laid cover out, on inclined shelving. On neither the left nor the right were there any spaces where a book shaped like my current enigma could have been.

I expanded my search up and down the current row, to meet with no success. Exasperated, I walked back towards the computer located in this section to see if I could retrieve any helpful information.

A search in the library's database turned up no results for that title, and with no author on the cover, I felt insulted. This was my section. My charge! What right did a book have to exist here and not in my knowledge of the collections? I flipped through the first few pages of the book, hoping for something, anything.

At that moment, my supervisor stalked into the room. I had been so preoccupied with my search that I had not heard the gentle 'pfft' on the vacuum seal door opening to admit her.

"Jeff! What are you doing here? Your shift was supposed to end 20 minutes ago."

"Mrs. Bergantz, I was just putting in a..."

"I don't care. You know the overtime policy. You do not enter this room unless you are still on the clock, young man." A stern look furrowed her brow.

I was twenty-three years old. I'm not sure I qualified as a 'young man' anymore, but she was my boss. She had just finally divorced her husband, whom she had married before I was born. From the accounts I had heard, their separation had been a long time coming. For the first few weeks after signing the papers, she had been cheery, but now she had thrown herself into her work, and it was an unwelcome surprise to find my workload suddenly doubled or tripled and micromanaged at every opportunity. One of those micromanaged items was the overtime policy. And by that, I really mean the absolutely-no-overtime-ever policy.

I shouldn't be so hard on her, really. She was the best boss I had ever had. I just wanted to start my summer already.

"Yes, Mrs. Bergantz." I was still standing at the computer. I silently closed the strange book in my hands, and without thinking about it I placed it in my backpack. I do not understand why I felt compelled to do so.

"Okay, Jeff. Out you go." She pressed the button to open the vacuum door, and once again a gentle 'pfft' escaped around the edges of the seal, as the pressure in the room equalized with that outside. I walked past her, nearly trembling underneath the weight of my deceit. Voices inside my skull screamed at me that I was committing a crime, that the book in my backpack would burn a whole through the rubberized bottom fabric and plop out behind me, condemning me to an aborted education. Book thief! I was a book thief!

I walked out in front of her, and just as the door closed behind her, she spoke once more.

"Oh, and Jeff?" I froze. I swear there was sweat trickling down my face.

"Have a great summer." Her voice was softer than before, and although I did not dare to turn around and show my guilty visage, I tried to manage my best warm but stiffly formal voice. "You too, Mrs. Bergantz."

I wanted to run, but I managed to walk all the way out of the library and back to my room without making eye contact with anyone. The heavy weight of *Omen Dictums* on my conscience still pressed against me, and I was short of breath by the time I made it back to my dormitory and up the stairs to my small single room.

I unlocked the door, opened it, walked through, closed it, and locked it again behind me in one fluid motion. I removed my backpack and placed it on the shoe mat. I sank to my knees, back against the door. I had just broken my contract with the library, and for now, I had gotten away with it. Thoughts of the fine print in my job agreement ran through my head, but slowly I began to think more like my usual self. My breathing slowly became more normal, my kidneys lowering their adrenaline output. I stared at my bag, just a foot or so away from the feet that had co-conspired in my theft.

It couldn't be that bad, could it? By all accounts, the book in my bag didn't even exist. I was the only one who had ever come across it. There was no entry in the library database, and a quick google on my phone showed no results for the book's title when I put quotation marks on each end. Nobody should know it was missing. And I didn't need to tell anyone. Just as long as I could slip it back into the collection somewhere at the beginning of next year...I should be fine. Right?

That was a rationalization I could cling to.

Opening my bag, I inspected my mysterious prize once again. I paged through the book, and as I was not interrupted this time, I found the opening inscription seven pages in.

> Fate is an unusual force. Fortuity and infortuity are but two sides of the same coin, and neither shall dominate the other for very long. Every sequence of events is governed by the probability of their reversal.
>
> I do not envy you who reads these words.

> In these pages, I have gathered the smatterings of ages and dimensions past and future, echoes and reverberations of the cosmic powers which once and forever rule our multiverse. Many things grotesque, ancient, bizarre, pure, dark, light, and gray, lurk in this tome. My time is not long, for I have called attention to myself by even thinking of the forces and entities which I inscribe here. Some of this work has been given to me by other revered scholars - some of it is original research - other pieces yet are fragments of dreams, prophetic visions, hallucinatory parables, channeled to the page through me, from a place I cannot describe or understand.

> But there is one thing I know.

> In the end, there is only Tum.

> There is no going back now, dear friend. Tum is coming, no matter your high-minded opinions of yourself. He follows no orders or patterns other than his own indeterminate ways, and the best we feeble creatures can do to ease our own passage is to know and understand what our insignificant psyches and constitutions can wither.

> With that sense of resolve, I beckon you to join me on this journey through the eons. It eases my mind that my ghost and spirit live on through you, dear reader.

> Would you please help satisfy the time and effort of an old man, friend?

I stayed up nearly the whole night, reading the strange and wondrous descriptions within. I barely noticed the passage of midnight, and leaving my desk, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. This morning I awoke to a knock on the door from my father, who had come down to help me move out. Just today I had a chance to write these thoughts into a form suitable for publication, but I must mull over many of the other things I have read before I place them here.

If you have any works which mention the name "Tum," or come across any mention of *Omen Dictums*, please write to me. As I have indeed committed a crime, I must take some efforts to protect my identity. I may be reached at 'librariansoftum@mailinator.com'. I hope to have a more permanent channel for communications soon.
