The following section from *Omen Dictums* is emblematic of much of the book - sections from another's account, in a different voice, with different details, and yet common elements. The language (and author's title) is wizened, and yet there are elements which come directly from modern experience. I can only understand this and many other accounts in the context of a *past-future*, a timeline which exists separate from our own and yet has shared pieces.

> I ran down the corridor, all sense of tactics gone as I strove to put that... that Thing behind me. Surely such a monumental mass couldn't move very quickly, and I needed to put as much distance between It and myself as possible before It cast Its all-seeing Eye upon me again and the world vanished.
>
> Yet I could still feel Its presence, no matter how far I ran. I feared that Its vastness was beyond the comprehension of the mortal mind — that It had insinuated Its flesh into all aspects of space-time and all aspects of consciousness, such that there was no place that was not Tum — that, as opposed to It awakening to me, I had awakened to It, a totality that was always there and would always be there. A totality that had no interest in anything except ingestion.

> The corridor reached a fork; one path led left, one path right. Straight ahead was a wall adorned with a mural depicting the great blood sacrifice our forefathers had made to keep this Singularity contained. It was an incredibly detailed work, the sky a kaleidoscope brimming with energy as people of every color and creed sacrificed their beautiful boys to appease those forces that knew not beauty, only destruction. Where were those brave heroes now, when the Tum was on the verge of getting lose? Was It escaping because the heroes were gone, their age of chivalry and oblation replaced with a new age of fornication and corruption? Or was It always bound to escape, a Force which not even the supernatural could hope to contain forever?

> After a moment of hesitation I ran to the left, not knowing where I was going, only feeling the panic of a rabbit set upon by a drone carrying a nuclear missile. I ran until I lost track of time, long past the point where I ran out of breath, always feeling that Presence within and around me—a voice whispered that It would always be with me, for the brief remainder of my life—as my pursuers kept pace behind. Then I came to another intersection, exactly the same as the first: a left fork, a right fork, the same mural as before straight ahead. I chose the right path this time, and though it twisted and turned and sloped upwards and downwards, it eventually left me at another identical intersection.
>
> It was at this point that I realized, the rainbow colors of the masterwork dancing in my vision, that my two choices were a false dichotomy — as, in fact, every choice I had ever made had always been. There were multiple paths, but ultimately only one road down which we all must go. The Presence was everywhere. All paths led to Tum.

Perhaps the strangest thing about this section is the context surrounding it in *Omen Dictums*. It sits next to other first-hand accounts of Tum, in no discernible order, but all with similar themes. Aside from the opening inscription, I have not read anything further from the ostensible author, Evoon the Sage. It is as if he wished for me to form my own opinions in this opening section, without introducing his own voice again.

All in all, a strange read. I feel compelled to stop here and rest my eyes and mind, for many questions and words remain.
