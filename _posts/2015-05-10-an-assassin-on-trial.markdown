This section occurs before the actual words of High Seeker Gloag the Black. By the accounts I have read thus far, he was one of the greatest minds of the Imperium, a governing body not far different from the Roman Empire in our timeline. His scholarly effort apparently placed him in the crosshairs.

> <<The Court>>: Do you know why you're here, accused?
>
> <<Shun>>: Do you know why YOU'RE here?  Too hard an answer for me, you know.  Haha, question for a question (quest-on?), poor manners you know.
>
> <<The Court>>: Do not play games!  You are accused of the murder of High Seeker Gloag the Black!
>
> <<Shun>>: Killed the seeker, yes.  Killed the black one.  Brought him home to nothing.  Better this way.  He was close, you know.  Close to nothing.
>
> <<The Court>>: So you do not deny it.  Why did you kill him?
>
> <<Shun>>: It was the way it had to be, only natural you see.  One cannot know the unknowable, you know?  Hahahaha!  HE does not allow it.
>
> <<The Court>>: Who is "he"?  Whom do you serve?
>
> <<Shun>>: I serve the nothing, hahahaha!  You'll know soon, too.  Your Imperium has been something for too long, almost your turn.
>
> <<The Court>>: Our turn...for what?
>
> <<Shun>>: To be nothing!  The seeker, he wanted you all to know the Tum.  You think I stopped him?  Haha, you WILL know Tum!  Know Tum, and know nothing!  HAHAHAHAHA, TUUUUUUM!
>
> Court Observer: Prisoner bites a nerve toxin pill concealed in a false tooth, gurgles, dies mid-laughter.
