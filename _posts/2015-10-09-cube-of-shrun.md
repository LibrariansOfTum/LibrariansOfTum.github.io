> The following message carries the highest priority.  It is for your eyes only and should be destroyed upon reading.  Our agency is working to suppress all knowledge of the object until such time as we understand its full meaning.  For what it's worth, sir, I hope they can make sense of this soon.  I don't like what it implies.

A second, following entry:

> The object was discovered embedded in a meteorite that hit ground in one of the uninhabited zones.  We've never seen anything like it before.  It was certainly created by some kind of intelligence.  Efforts to analyze its composition have all ended in frustration--a unique material that seems to have properties of both metal and stone.  Whatever the material is, it certainly doesn't occur naturally on this planet.  Even more frustrating, we have no idea how old it is.  NO idea.  It could be one year old, or one million.  Maybe much older.  The cube seems to respond to touch somehow, its precise carvings actually changing shape to an alphabet understandable by the one who touches it.  We've tested this with multiple foreigners and witnessed their respective languages represented.  When touched by one of the test ferrets, the writing becomes something unrecognizable.  The technology behind this is truly astonishing.  One of the cube's outer surfaces displays large, central runes.  Upon touching the cube for the first time, they arrange themselves to read: SHRUN.
