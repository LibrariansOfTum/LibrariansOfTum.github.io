A great Seer, Roob Derfy the Cursed, writes of one of the home realms of Tum, a desolate wasteland.

> The wasteland stretches on seemingly forever.  The shifting sands are strewn with the shattered remnants of temples and altars to millions of gods.  Their silent visages, some recognizably human and others indescribable, stare sadly into the void.  Mountains and bizarre, alien structures float through the dark purple skies like lonely ships cast adrift and forgotten.  A sullen light lies on the wastes with no discernible source.
>
> The beast Tum walks the wastes, over the sands and forgotten gods.  A tremendous, horrid mass of flesh, it is almost unthinkable.  Its eyes are two black pinpoints barely visible beneath the folds of its eyelids.  What lies beneath them has never been known to anyone.  Its hulking flaps of feet crush the sad altars as it walks.  Its destination, if it has one, is beyond all but eternity.  It is Tum, the devourer, the end of everything.
>
> In its wake marches a man, far smaller than the beast.  Hanging from his shoulders is a bass drum, which he strikes with the bone of a creature whose name has long been lost to time.  On his head he wears a tall hat, as might have been worn by a member of a marching band.  But it is filthy, tattered and stained.  He is Shrun the Mad, herald of the beast.  No one remembers who he was before, if he was anyone before.  He follows the Tum, his eyes shining with the madness of oblivion.
>
> Together they walk to the beat of Grunty Industries, a song with no end that echoes over the wasteland.  It comes from nowhere, seemingly part of the beast's presence.  Shrun the Mad strikes his bass drum to the beat of the maddening song.  With every strike he chants "Tum...Tum...Tum".
> 
> As the two forms merge with the horizon, I realize that I don't remember how I came to this lonely void.  But I know that I've seen something no mortal should see.  I've seen the end, and I realize that WE are its destination.  And then the dream ends, and I wake trembling in my bed.  I have had this dream every night for the last eight months.  But I know it isn't just a dream.  Something is coming."
